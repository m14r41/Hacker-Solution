# Semgrep Scan

The Bash script utilizes ANSI color codes to create a visually appealing menu-driven interface. It facilitates Semgrep scans with various configurations, featuring dynamic elements such as blinking boxes. Users choose from options, including custom Semgrep commands. Post-execution, the script organizes output files into a designated folder, displaying a completion message. Semgrep must be installed, and the script assumes `semgrep` is in the system's PATH.
